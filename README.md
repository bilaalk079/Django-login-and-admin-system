A beautiful Django project that i used to practice django.
it has a registration page where you can register new users.
it has a login page where each user can login.
it also has an admin login.

//For the ADMIN.
You register an admin by going to localhost:8000/regadmin.
if you want to login as an admin it is the same login page You will use.
the admin can block and unblock users.
the admin can also delete users.
//The Users
As for the users dashboard I only created a home page where they can view their details .
And a edit profile page where they can edit their profile and save the changes.
